Node.js 

File System:
● Write a Node.js script that reads a JSON file containing user data, manipulates the data to include the total number of posts each user has created, and writes the modified data back to a new JSON file.

Files
-> fsModule.js
-> oldJSONFile.json
-> newJSONFile.json

To start server
--> node fsModule.js


Node.js API Integration :
● Create a Node.js function that fetches data from an external API (e.g.,JSONPlaceholder) and returns a list of users along with their posts.

Files
->apiIntegration.js
->usersWithPosts.json

To start the server
--> node apiIntegration.js
