# Database Concepts (5 points):

### ‚óè Explain the difference between SQL and NoSQL databases. Provide examples of use cases for each.

SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases are different types of database management systems, each with its own characteristics and use cases.

# SQL Databases:

## Structure:
SQL databases are relational databases, which means they organize data into tables with predefined schemas.
Data is stored in rows and columns, and relationships between tables are established using keys.

## Scalability:
SQL databases are typically scaled vertically by adding more horsepower (CPU, RAM, SSD) to a single server.

## Consistency:
ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) ensure data integrity in transactions.

## Examples:
MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server.

## Use Cases:
Applications with complex queries and transactions, where data integrity is critical.
Well-defined and structured data with a fixed schema.

# NoSQL Databases:

## Structure:
NoSQL databases are non-relational and provide a flexible schema.
Data can be stored in various formats like JSON, BSON, XML, etc.

## Scalability:
NoSQL databases are typically scaled horizontally by adding more servers to the database.
Consistency:

May sacrifice some aspects of consistency in favor of availability and partition tolerance (CAP theorem).

## Examples:
MongoDB, Cassandra, CouchDB, Redis.

## Use Cases:
Large-scale applications with rapidly changing and evolving data.
Unstructured or semi-structured data, like social media posts, logs, and user-generated content.
Distributed systems where horizontal scalability is crucial.

## Summary:
SQL databases are suitable for applications with well-defined schemas, complex queries, and transactions that require strict data integrity.

NoSQL databases are more suitable for dynamic, evolving data structures and applications that prioritize scalability and performance over rigid consistency.

Choosing between SQL and NoSQL depends on the specific requirements of the application and the nature of the data it handles. Often, a hybrid approach, using both types of databases for different parts of an application, is employed to leverage the strengths of each.
