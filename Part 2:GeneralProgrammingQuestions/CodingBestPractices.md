# Coding Best Practices:

### ‚óè Discuss three coding best practices that you consider important for maintaining a clean and efficient codebase.

## Make Your Code Easy to Read:

Use consistent indentation and formatting so your code looks organized.
Give your variables and functions names that describe what they do.
Add comments to explain tricky parts of your code, but try to make your code as clear as possible without comments.


## Break Your Code into Small Parts:

Each part of your code (like a function or module) should do just one thing.
Don't let one part of your code know too much about how another part works. Keep things separate.
Imagine your code is like a puzzle, and each piece (function or module) fits neatly into its own spot.


## Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY):

If you find yourself writing the same code in multiple places, try to put that code in one central spot and use it everywhere you need it.
Avoid copying and pasting code because if you need to change something, you'll have to do it in multiple places.
